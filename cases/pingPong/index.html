            <span class="bold">Overview</span><br /><br />
            
            Google hosted the world's first WebRTC Hackathon at their Stockholm offices in 2012. My group developed a concept and started working on a prototype using the new technology. The basic idea is people can play ping pong with each other using a web browser.<br /><br />
            
            <span class="bold">Background</span><br /><br />
            
            WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a new technology that will be introduced to web browsers in the coming months. It allows video chat and voice calling without the the need of plugins. As the stream is browser-based, it is possible to manipulate sound and video in real-time with the use of Javascript.<br /><br />
            
            <span class="bold">Process</span><br /><br />
            
            The hackathon was around 10 hours long, and my group had never met before, so the process was a more accelerated version than usual.<br /><br />

I led an idea generation session that considered the possibilities of webRTC and our specialities, and this followed a convergent - divergent idea generation mode. We decided on the concept, the techniques we would use and the design principles by the end of morning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(coffee_break)" target="_blank">fika</a>, and then started to build the hack. By the end of the hackathon, we were about an hour away from a working prototype.<br /><br />Our hack was featured on Google's <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/04/WebRTC-Protothon" target="_blank">html5rocks.com</a>, and has been used as an example of the future of the web in a few presentations. We were also in talks with Google for them to use the hack to demonstrate WebRTC on it's release, sadly this didn't work out though.<br /><br />
            


<span class="bold">My Role</span><br /><br />

I developed the concept and was responsible for animating the data that came from both players through WebRTC, so that the ping pong ball would appear to move in a fluid way. I used a mixture of javascript, jQuery, and HTML5's canvas tag.  I also added sound effects. This animation was then overlaid on the WebRTC chat interface.<br /><br />

<span class="bold">Learning WebRTC</span><br /><br />

I made a another WebRTC <a href="cases/pingPong/hdn/index.html" target="_blank">webapp</a> the night before the hackathon, just to familiarise myself with how the new technology works. It essentially makes the user the star of The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night album cover. It captures a user's image every few seconds (allowing them to strike a different pose), and overlays this image on one of the windows of the album cover. WebRTC is so cutting edge that it only works on the most recent version of Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Chrome Browser</a>. Other browsers will be supported in the future.<br /><br />
