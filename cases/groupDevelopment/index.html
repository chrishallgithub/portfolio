            <span class="bold">Overview</span><br /><br />
            
            I believe in teamwork, and I have experience in facilitating group development.<br /><br />
            

            
            <span class="bold">Facilitating the Hyper Island Way</span><br /><br />
            
            Over the last two years I’ve worked as a Facilitator for <a href="http://www.hyperisland.com/" target="_blank">Hyper Island</a> during its introductory week for new students. <br /><br />Hyper Island’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/7885122" target="_blank">methodology</a> is different to almost every other learning establishment in the world.

The introductory week is an extremely intense, joyful and rewarding experience, where participants learn not only about themselves, but a whole range of other things.<br /><br />

The focus is on learning by doing, group dynamics, feedback, reflection, and above all, creating a constructive social arena. The importance of “How” a task is completed is given equal importance to “What” is actually done.<br /><br />

I’m comfortable teaching the methodology to large and small groups.<br /><br />

			<span class="bold">Background</span><br /><br />
            
            Hyper Island’s methodology  has it’s roots in the <a href="http://www.fhs.se/sv/utbildning/uppdragsutbildningar/ledarskap/ugl/ugl/" target="_blank">UGL system</a> developed by the Swedish Military, and the research of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_development#Wheelan.E2.80.99s_Integrated_Model_of_Group_Development" target="_blank">Susan Wheelan</a>. A good place to start learning about group development would be Susan Wheelan's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Creating-Effective-Teams-Members-Leaders/dp/1412975158/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1347973373&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Creating Effective Teams</a>.<br /><br />
            
            <span class="bold">Application</span><br /><br />

I use Hyper Island's Methodology in my working practices, and I am comfortable either leading the process or being an active member of a group.
