            <span class="bold">Overview</span><br /><br />
            
            
            Sweden's National Modern Art Museum, <a href="http://modernamuseet.se/" target="_blank">Moderna Museet</a>, was one of my groupâ€™s clients whilst we ran our agency, <a href="https://www.chrishall.se/#!megaphone" target="_blank">Megaphone</a>.<br /><br />

			The concept we delivered for them essentially makes the museum and its collection more accessible.<br /><br />
            
            <span class="bold">Brief</span><br /><br />
            
			Moderna asked us to "Make a proposal for a smartphone application with emphasis on content in terms of knowledge of and proximity to the works of art".<br /><br />
            
            <span class="bold">Background</span><br /><br />
            
            With the arrival of a new major <a href="http://en.fotografiska.eu/" target="_blank">photograhy museum</a> in Stockholm, Moderna Museet were going through a period of reflection regarding their position at the forefront of art & culture in Sweden.<br /><br />
            
            One key insight was that Moderna Museet has one of the largest collections of art in Europe, but many pieces are rarely shown, due to space limitations.<br /><br />
            
            <span class="bold">Solution</span><br /><br />
            
            Features of the smartphone app:<br /><br />
            
            An integrated map system helps with navigation to and around the museum.<br /><br />
            Visits can be planned in detail, based on interests, duration of visit & the people you are with<br /><br />
            Suggested routes around the museum can be created, allowing a more personal and rewarding experience<br /><br />
            The story of a different piece of art is told every day, spreading knowledge & making art more accessible<br /><br />
            Browse parts of the collection that are not currently on show<br /><br />
            Visitors can decide how much they want to know about each piece<br /><br />
            Visitors can save their favourite pieces of art, helping them to remember details, and plan future visits<br /><br />
            QR codes link visitors to a guide that takes the form of a puppet version of Robert Rauschenberg's Monogram (a very important piece for the museum). The puppet introduces art in an entertaining and informative way<br /><br />
            
            <span class="bold">My role</span><br /><br />
            
             By the later stages of the module, my CEO responsibilities demanded less of my time, and so I was able to contribute to production where I was needed. I was also involved in the ealier Idea Generation part of the project.
        <br /><br />
        I co-wrote and edited the case movie shown above. I learnt a tremendous amount over the weekend it was made. In hindsight, I should have included a voice-over, shortened a few scenes and include more visuals. In terms of overall style, I guess you could say it's my homage to John Hughes's film, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubpRcZNJAnE" target="_blank">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a>.
        <br /><br />
        The awesome goat puppet that is briefly seen in the movie was made by Fia and Mike. It was named and designed in honour of Robert Rauschenberg's "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2006/jan/26/art1" target="_blank">"Monogram"</a>". You can see <a href="https://vimeo.com/35984270" target="_blank">Monogram in action</a>, and here's an <a href="https://vimeo.com/35986428" target="_blank">outtake</a>. Fia & I wrote the copy, and I did the narration and puppetry work.
        <br /><br />
        
        The working smartphone app you see in the video is actually only a front-end mock-up I built. This was to demonstrate the app's possibilities in action.<br /><br />
