To gain real-life experience of running an agency, one module at Hyper Island involved forming and running an agency. We named our agency Megaphone. I was the CEO.<br /><br />

<span class="bold">My role</span><br /><br />

My management style is very adaptable. Certain groups have certain needs, and to impose a rigid management style can lead to uninvolved, unmotivated groups. I believe in discussing solutions rather than dictating terms. I believe in helping people realising their full potential, rather than setting unchallenging tasks. Above all, I believe in inclusion and transparency. At Megaphone, I listened to what our agency and our clients needed. From this, I was able to guide the agency in an informed and responsive way.<br /><br />
<!--
I also kept the agency on budget, and looked for ways to expand the business, Although the money we played with wasn't real, our profit margin was very healthy.<br /><br />

By the end of the module, we had designed the world's first Democracy app for <a href="http://www.nacka.se" target="_new">Nacka Kommun</a> (a municipality of Stockholm), as well as an app for Sweden's <a href="https://chrishall.se/#!moderna">National Modern Art Museum</a>. There was a competition run by Hyper Island to discover the best agency. We won.<br /><br />
