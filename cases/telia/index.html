                <span class="bold">Overview</span><br /><br />
                            "Join-Up Your Life" is a concept my group developed for <a href="http://www.telia.se/privat/" target="_new">Telia</a>, Sweden's largest telecoms operator.<br /><br />
                
                <span class="bold">Brief</span><br /><br />
                
                "How can Telia better use the mobile channel in the future?".<br /><br />
                
                As the boundaries between different modes of communication are blurring, we agreed to change the brief to "How can Telia enhance the future of connectivity?". Telia wanted us to consider what the company would look like in a few years time.<br /><br />
                
                <span class="bold">Background</span><br /><br />
                
                There is a danger that telecoms operators are becoming seen as just a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumb_pipe" target="_new">dumb pipe</a> who merely provide connections to other services.<br /><br />
                
                Telia currently offer many fragmented services. These range from telephony, TV, ISP and even smartphone apps.<br /><br />
                
                <span class="bold">Solution</span><br /><br />
                
                We thought Telia should change their perspective. Rather than just describe their offer (which leads to the inevitable price/ feature war amongst operators) we thought they should think more about why they offered their services, and the benefits that these services offer people. This approach was to be considered by the whole company to inform it's outlook and accountability, and not just used as a sales technique. We wanted to find Telia’s reason for getting out of bed.<br /><br />
                
                Our insight was that there are many companies that can offer the same services as Telia, but no one company is currently connecting all these services in a coherent manner. We therefore suggested that Telia should help people "Join-Up" their lives.<br /><br />
                
                The delivery of Telia’s message would change as a result of this. Instead of stating <i>what</i> Telia offers or <i>how</i> it offers it, the new focus would be on <i>why</i> it does what it does. “Join-Up Your Life” is a concept that describes Telia's outlook, as well as why people should consider them.<br /><br />
                
                As companies become more social and interactive, they have to become more accountable for their actions. Technology allows for better targeting of advertisements, so that the right message is delivered to the right person at the right time. Blanket-bombing messages, and shouting slogans at customers can be replaced by more engaging conversations. Communicating WHY is a big part of this. I'm specifically interested in this development, as it means that companies are empowered to treat people as people, and not just consumers. In the future, advertising can actually be helpful and be welcomed.<br /><br />
                
                
                <span class="bold">My role</span><br /><br />
                
                I worked on the Strategy, Concept Development, Art Direction and Design of the video, wrote the Copy, and narrated the video.<br /><br />
                
                <span class="bold">Creative Process</span><br /><br />
                
                The research completed during the initial Strategy phase of the project was separated from the Idea Generation/ Concept Development phase. This allowed us to separate the different ways of thinking. We then used several iterations of a divergent/ convergent thinking process, the result of which was then polished during the Concept Development phase.<br /><br />
                
                <span class="bold">Production</span><br /><br />
                
                The video was produced over 3 weeks and involved many late nights of Photoshop, printing and cutting out (of course, everything was recycled), and trying to discover the best work-flow. It was intense, but it was very educational. Our process was far from perfect, but this experience has given me insights that have helped me develop my own processes and management skills.<br /><br />
